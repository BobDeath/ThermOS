## Setup
This thermostat requires the use of a **DS18B20** temperature sensor. **An alternative sensor can be used, but the getIndoorTemp.py file will need to be modified to gather and return the correct data.** I may at some point add the option to use a DHT-22 (combo temp/humidity sensor); but this is adequate for now. 

On a fresh Raspbian Jessie image (full or lite)<br>

```
cd ~  
git clone https://github.com/mholgatem/ThermOS  
cd ~/ThermOS  
sudo bash install.sh
```
On a computer or smartphone, navigate to the ip address of your raspberry pi to finish setup.
